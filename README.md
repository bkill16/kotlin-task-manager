# Overview

This is a simple task management application developed in Kotlin,
designed to help users manage their to-do lists.

This project marks my initial steps in learning Kotlin, serving as
a hands-on way to practice and strengthen my skills with the 
language. In creating this project, I aimed to gain practical 
experience in writing Kotlin code while exploring the language's 
features and syntax.

This application allows users to:
* Add, remove, and update the completion status of tasks.
* Save their task list to a file.
* Load their task list from a saved file to continue managing
tasks at any time.

This project helped me become familiar with Kotlin's handling of 
collections, file operations, and user input.

# Development Environment

I developed this application using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition,
an IDE specifically designed for Kotlin and Java development. 
Additionally, I used the Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit) to run
and compile the Kotlin code.

In this project, I did not utilize any external libraries. I used
Kotlin's built-in capabilities for handling collections, file I/O
operations, and user-input.

# Future Work

- Refactor code to utilize classes.
- Add more attributes to tasks such as due dates, descriptions, 
  etc.
- Create a notification system to send reminders or alert users of
  upcoming tasks.
